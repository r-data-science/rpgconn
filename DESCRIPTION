Description: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing PostgreSQL
    database connection settings. Supports standard PostgreSQL URI connection
    strings (postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db) with query parameters, IPv6
    hosts, and URL-encoded credentials. The package supplies helper functions
    to create, edit and load connection and option configuration files stored
    in a user-specific directory using the 'RPostgres' back end. These helpers
    make it easy to construct a reproducible connection string from a
    configuration file, either by reading user-defined YAML files or by parsing
    an environment variable. Validation-first architecture provides clear,
    actionable error messages instead of cryptic connection failures.
