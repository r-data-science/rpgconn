Description: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing PostgreSQL
    database connection settings.  The package supplies helper functions to
    create, edit and load connection and option configuration files stored in a
    user-specific directory using the 'odbc' and 'RPostgres' back ends.  These
    helpers make it easy to construct a reproducible connection string from a
    configuration file, either by reading user-defined YAML files or by parsing
    an environment variable.
